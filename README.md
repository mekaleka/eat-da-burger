## Description
In this app the user is able to create their own custom sandwich or hamburger. In fact the user may create an array of different burgers so that they can then choose which one to devour. Once devoured, the chosen burger is then able to be deleted by the user so it is removed from that list of yummy burgers. 
 
This is a great application because it demonstrates how easy it is to tie front and back end technologies together by using MySQL, Express and handlebars. It shows how you can take complex applications and easily mesh them together to ensure your code is performant.
